In today's digital age, having an online presence is no longer a luxury—it's a necessity. Yet, many small and medium-sized businesses(SMBs) around us still operate without websites, Limiting their visibility and growth potential.

As a digital entrepreneur, I recently took a step toward bridging that gap, O complied a list of local businesses near me in Abuja—from consultant t0 cafes—that don't yet have a website. These business represent a massive untapped potential for digital transformation.

## WHy This Matters

Here's the truth: when people want to find a product or service, they search online first. A business without a website misses countless opportunities everyday single day. whether it's:

- A customer searching for a nearby restaurant,
- A client looking for a consultant,
- Or someone needing a quick service—they're all going online.

## The Mission: Connecting The Business to the Web

After identifying over 45 businesses around Gwarinpa, Dawaki, and Kubwa, I decided not to sit back. I recruited three passionate individuals to help me personally pitch tailored website services to these local business owners.
