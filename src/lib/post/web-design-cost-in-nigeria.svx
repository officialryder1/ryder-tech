<h1 class=" tracking-wider text-center"> Detailed Guide on <b style="color: orange">Price of Website Design in Nigeria</b></h1>

Up-to-date breakdown of what it will cost you to own a website in 2025

[web design cost](https://ebrandpromotion.com/quote/) varies a great deal from one designer to the next, in fact, it is safe to say there is no universally accepted price for any web design project.

However, in this article, I will attempt to give you an idea of what it will cost you to design a functional quality website. The breakdown i give here will be greatly influenced by my own 12-year experience as a web developer and interaction with several other top-notch web designers in Nigeria.

The cost of creating a website can be divided into 4 basic categories, 
These include;

1. DOMAIN NAME.

This is your website unique address on the internet. And it has extensions such as .com, .net, .org etc.

2. HOSTING FEE.

Your Hosting account is where your website's files are stored and accessed and the types vary based on the type of website you want to store.

3. SSL CERTIFICATE.

This ensures secure data transmission between server and browser. To confirm if a site has SSl, check for a padlock icon at the left of your browser.


4. WEB DEVELOPER'S FEE

This is the amount charged for professional website design and development services

> Note: SSL certificate is now a must for all browsers and search engines. So if your site doesn’t have it, it will be flagged as insecured. That alone is a big dent on your reputation. So, therefore, it’s now a must-have feature.

> So below is an outline of all the monies you are likely to spend on your next web design project. Also beware that since there is no fixed price, I will stick to price ranges. Finally, Naira/dollar exchange rate fluctuation is one of the most important factors you need to have in mind. For the purpose of this article, exchange rate is pegged at NGN1500/dollar


## Domain Name Registration

N20000 – N35000 per year.

Owing to the increase in the exchange rate, this is the price you are most likely to pay for a name that is free and available for registration.

If you need a .ng domain, the price ranges between N15,000 – N25,000.

However, you may want a name that is already taken by someone else. For that, you will have to place a backorder for it (that is contracting a domain broker like Godaddy or Namecheap to purchase it for you as soon as it is free).

This costs about $69. But if you are buying from another individual, then the price can be a lot higher – running into thousands of dollars.

Generally, if you don’t have a specific need for a particular name, just choose an alternative.

Personally, my normal strategy for getting the names I want is to go for the .com.ng or .ng extension.

For example, when I was launching a new startup back in 2015, I wanted www.thesummary.com but of course, that wasn’t available and I couldn’t change the name of the business, so I simply opted for thesummary.com.ng. And the site went on to do quite well. You too may apply this same strategy.


# WEB HOSTING FEE

web hosting comes in various categories. There are generally 4 basic categoriesIt could be;

Shared hosting,
Virtual Private Server (VPS)
Cloud hosting
Dedicated server
The category you choose depends on the number of visitors that come to the website on a monthly basis.

If you need just a business website for your company, it is okay to use shared hosting.

On the other hand, if your website is going to serve a large audience, it’s safest to go for a VPS or cloud hosting.

This type of hosting is recommended for blogs with a lot of visitors monthly or a church or association with a large membership
